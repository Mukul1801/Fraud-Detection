# Fraud Detection Model
1. Fraud Detection Model is a project I made using a fraud dataset available on Kaggle to classify transactions as fraudulent. The notebook also has a summary section where I have shared my key findings and recommendations. I had two datasets, one for training the model and other for scoring the model.
